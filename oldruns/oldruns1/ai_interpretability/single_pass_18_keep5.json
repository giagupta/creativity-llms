This makes it difficult to trace how specific input features contribute to a particular output, resulting in \"black-box\" behavior that undermines trust, hinders debugging, and limits accountability. Unlike simpler models with explicit rules or coefficients, neural networks distribute learned knowledge broadly and nonlinearly, complicating efforts to generate precise, human-understandable explanations for individual decisions or global reasoning patterns.\n\nA concrete approach to improve interpretability is to develop modular, self-explaining neural architectures combined with integrated prototype learning. Specifically, one can design networks with dedicated interpretable components, such as layers that explicitly learn and output human-understandable concepts or prototypes representing key input patterns, alongside conventional predictive units. During training, the model is constrained through additional losses to align these prototypes with semantically meaningful data clusters, while explanations for predictions are generated by showing similarity scores between inputs and prototypes. This method is feasible using existing prototype learning frameworks and leverages domain knowledge to ensure meaningful concepts emerge, enabling practitioners to gain intuitive, case-level insights into the decision-making process without sacrificing accuracy. Such modular interpretability fosters transparency and trust in high-stakes applications.",
