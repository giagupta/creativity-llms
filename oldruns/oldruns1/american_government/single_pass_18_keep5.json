    "final_output": "A significant structural problem in the American government is the increasing polarization and gridlock within the legislative branch, notably in the Senate. The filibuster rule, which requires a 60-vote supermajority to close debate on most legislation, often empowers a minority to block bills favored by the majority, leading to legislative stagnation and an inability to respond effectively to urgent national issues. This structural feature exacerbates partisan divides and diminishes public trust in government efficacy.\n\nA concrete and feasible solution is to reform the filibuster by returning it to its original form, which required continuous talking by the minority to sustain a filibuster (the \u201ctalking filibuster\u201d). This adjustment would maintain minority rights to debate and delay legislation but force actual effort to block bills, discouraging frivolous or purely obstructive use. By raising the practical cost of filibustering, this reform would encourage compromise and greater legislative productivity while preserving a critical check on majority power. It is specific because it targets a defined procedural rule, feasible because it can be enacted by the Senate itself without constitutional amendment, and justified as a balance between minority rights and effective governance.",
