These committees would operate with greater procedural flexibility and reduced partisan controls, enabling faster, context-sensitive policy development.

These councils would jointly draft, implement, and review policy in real time, balancing legal, political, and executive perspectives collaboratively rather than confrontationally.

This systemic adversarial structure undermines government responsiveness by rewarding obstruction rather than collaboration, even when bipartisan consensus is in the public interest.  \n\nBy breaking the assumption that elections and legislative processes must be strictly adversarial, we can introduce a mandated, ranked-choice hybrid parliamentarism system where coalitions are formed pre-election based on negotiated agendas\u2014candidates run within parties that must publicly align with cross-party coalition platforms. Legislative power would hinge on fulfilling these coalition commitments to retain coalition status and resources. This structurally incentivizes cooperation before and after elections rather than obstruction. Because coalitions are accountable to shared platforms, government would become more stable and responsive, reducing gridlock by aligning incentives around negotiated policy goals rather than zero-sum victories, thus transforming adversarial competition into collaborative governance.",
