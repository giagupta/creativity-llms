The two-year House election cycle pressures representatives to prioritize short-term political gains and reactive policymaking over complex, multi-year strategic initiatives. This results in legislative gridlock, policy inconsistency, and underinvestment in critical areas like infrastructure, climate change, and education reform. The structural issue lies not just in partisanship but in the fundamental incentive system that prioritizes frequent campaigning over governance continuity.\n\nA novel and feasible solution is to implement staggered, longer multi-year terms for House members, locked to regional policy boards comprising local experts and civic leaders who co-develop long-term legislative agendas. Specifically, House members would serve six-year terms staggered so only a third face election every two years, while independent regional policy boards\u2014rotating every three years\u2014would work collaboratively with representatives to draft evidence-based multi-decade plans addressing regional priorities. This institutional coupling would shift incentives from short-term campaigning to sustained governance, embed expert input directly into legislative priorities, and create a self-perpetuating cycle focused on long-term regional development. By structurally integrating expert-guided strategic planning with extended terms, the government can overcome the cyclical volatility inherent in current election-driven policymaking.",
