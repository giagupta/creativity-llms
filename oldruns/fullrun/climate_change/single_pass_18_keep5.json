Current property rights systems, often rigid and locally siloed, discourage collective investments that benefit entire neighborhoods or cities, resulting in disjointed, piecemeal interventions that fail to capitalize on synergies or economies of scale across urban environments.\n\nA feasible, unconventional intervention would be to establish semi-public \u201cClimate Commons Districts\u201d (CCDs) within metropolitan areas, where land ownership rights are pooled into community-managed trusts that enable integrated planning and deployment of climate infrastructure. These trusts would balance private interests with binding community stewardship, facilitating cross-property upgrades like interconnected green roofs, shared solar arrays, and flood management systems. By institutionalizing shared land governance dedicated to climate resilience and emissions reduction, CCDs would unlock cooperative investment at scales impossible under fragmented ownership, dramatically accelerating urban climate adaptation while fostering equitable benefit-sharing.
