This \u201cmoral disengagement\u201d is reinforced by a lack of direct sensory or emotional engagement with these animals, who are rarely seen in their living conditions, reducing empathy and ethical concern.\n\nA concrete and novel intervention to shift behavior at scale would be to integrate immersive, mixed-reality experiences showcasing the life cycles and environments of factory-farmed animals into everyday grocery shopping environments via augmented reality (AR) glasses or smartphone apps.
