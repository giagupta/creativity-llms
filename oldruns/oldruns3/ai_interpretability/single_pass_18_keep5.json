Traditional methods, such as feature importance scores or saliency maps, often provide only coarse or unstable explanations that can be misleading, limiting trust and usability in high-stakes domains such as healthcare or finance.\n\nA concrete approach to improve interpretability is to incorporate \"concept bottlenecks\" into the model architecture. Specifically, during training, the network is constrained to first predict a set of human-understandable intermediate concepts (e.g., medical symptoms or visual attributes) before producing the final output.
