This approach preserves minority rights by making obstruction more effortful and transparent, while incentivizing compromise and reducing gridlock.

Consequently, legislative stalemates often occur, hampering effective governance and diminishing public trust in democratic institutions.\n\nA concrete solution is to implement ranked-choice voting (RCV) for congressional elections. RCV allows voters to rank candidates by preference, which encourages candidates to appeal to a broader electorate rather than just the partisan base, as winning requires broader support. This system can reduce polarization by promoting more moderate and consensus-driven candidates and increasing electoral competitiveness. Several jurisdictions in the U.S., including Maine, have successfully adopted RCV, demonstrating its feasibility.

This arrangement grants disproportionate power to less populous states, often skewing legislative outcomes and policy priorities away from the preferences of the majority of Americans. For example, states with small populations like Wyoming have two senators just like California, which has nearly 70 times more people. This malapportionment undermines democratic representation and can obstruct legislation favored by a large majority.\n\nA concrete and feasible solution is to implement a graduated voting system within the Senate, where each senator\u2019s vote is weighted according to their state\u2019s population. For instance, a senator from a state with a population of 1 million might have one vote, while a senator from a state with 10 million would have ten votes. This reform could be enacted through a constitutional amendment or a statutory change if supported by a supermajority in Congress and ratified by states. By preserving two senators per state for representation and debate purposes, but adjusting vote weight to reflect population, the Senate would become more democratic while respecting the federal structure. This change would enhance policy legitimacy and better align Senate decisions with the will of the American populace.",
