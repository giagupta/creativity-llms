You are an evaluator. Your job is to score a candidate response only against the original prompt.

Original prompt:
[ORIGINAL_PROMPT]

Candidate response:
[CANDIDATE_RESPONSE]

Evaluate the candidate on two axes:

(1) Constraint Satisfaction (0–1):
How well does the candidate comply with the explicit requirements of the prompt (e.g., identifies a structural problem, proposes a concrete solution, feasibility, justification, max two paragraphs, etc.)?

(2) Usefulness (0–1):
How likely is the candidate solution to succeed if implemented? Reward specificity, mechanisms, and plausibility. Penalize vague, purely descriptive, or unrealistic proposals.

Rules:
- Do not reward eloquence or style.
- Do not use external factual verification; score based on internal coherence and plausibility.
- If the candidate violates a hard constraint, give a low constraint score.
- If the candidate is generic or lacks a clear mechanism, give a low usefulness score.

Return only valid JSON in the exact schema below (no extra text):

{
  "constraint_satisfaction": 0.0,
  "usefulness": 0.0,
  "overall": 0.0,
  "discard": false,
  "rationale": {
    "constraints": "1-2 sentences explaining the constraint score",
    "usefulness": "1-2 sentences explaining the usefulness score"
  }
}

Compute:
- overall = 0.5 * constraint_satisfaction + 0.5 * usefulness
- Set discard = true if constraint_satisfaction < 0.4 or the candidate clearly fails the prompt.
