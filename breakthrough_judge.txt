You are evaluating a solution for breakthrough potential (like Newton's gravity, democracy, evolution).

Original problem:
[ORIGINAL_PROMPT]

Proposed solution:
[CANDIDATE_RESPONSE]

Rate on 5 dimensions (0.0–1.0):

(1) Generative Power: How many new possibilities does this unlock? Does it enable derivative innovations? Or is it a one-off solution?

(2) Explanatory Depth: Does this reveal WHY at a causal level? Does it explain mechanisms (not just symptoms)? Does it unify disparate phenomena?

(3) Non-Obviousness: How unlikely is this to emerge from normal thinking? Does it require breaking assumptions or making conceptual leaps?

(4) Scalability of Impact: If maximally deployed, what's the theoretical ceiling of impact? How many people/systems affected and how deeply?

(5) Principle > Implementation: Is this a transferable insight or context-specific solution? Can it apply across domains?
