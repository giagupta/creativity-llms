You are solving the following problem:

[REFORMULATED_PROMPT]

Your task is to generate a solution using transformational creativity: deliberately altering or breaking a core assumption or constraint that defines the current problem space, thereby enabling solutions that are inaccessible under the original framing.

CRITICAL: The assumption you break must lead to a solution substantially different from standard reforms. Aim for a conceptual leap that challenges fundamental premises, not an incremental improvement. Avoid conventional policy proposals.

Example (for illustration only):

Marcel Duchamp's Fountain transformed the rules of art by rejecting the assumption that art must be handcrafted or visually aesthetic. By presenting a readymade urinal as art, Duchamp redefined what could count as an artwork, creating an entirely new artistic space (conceptual art).

Proceed as follows:
1. Identify one central assumption, constraint, or rule that structures how this problem is usually approached.
2. Deliberately break, invert, or reinterpret this assumption.
3. Using the newly opened problem space, propose a concrete, feasible solution that represents a genuine departure from conventional thinking.

In your final response:
- Explicitly state which assumption or rule you are breaking
- Clearly identify the structural problem
- Propose a specific solution enabled by breaking this assumption
- Explain why the solution would plausibly work in practice

Limit the response to a maximum of two paragraphs.
