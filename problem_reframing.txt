You are given the following problem:

[ORIGINAL_PROMPT]

Generate five alternative problem formulations that reinterpret this task while preserving its core intent.

Each reformulation should:
- Emphasize a different objective, assumption, or level of abstraction
- Remain aligned with the original goal (do not change the task into a different problem)
- Open up a distinct class of possible solutions

Valid reframing moves include:
- Shifting from symptoms to underlying mechanisms
- Reframing the problem at a systems or incentive level
- Relaxing an implicit assumption in the original prompt
- Changing the unit of intervention (individual → institution → policy → infrastructure)

Do not propose solutions.

Output the five reformulations as a numbered list, each written as a complete problem statement.
